/*
To handle the divide by zero error in SQL Server
you can use the NULLIF function to return a null value if the divisor is zero. 
Hereâ€™s an example code snippet that you can use to modify your SQL query:

SELECT column1 / NULLIF(column2, 0) AS result FROM your_table

This will return a null value if the divisor is zero and prevent the divide by zero error1. 
You can replace column1, column2, and your_table with the appropriate column names and table name.

ALTER TABLE CovidDeaths ALTER COLUMN total_cases float  -- I hade to make some changes on the formating on the table
i got an erro about some of th data on some colums being varchar and i had to change them to numbers
the code quiry before this text if the one i used
first i used int to change the colums to integer but i got 0 as a result of the division
the when i change them to floats it worked
